# Munch

Munch offers an Android App, Alexa Skill and Online Dashboard that connects restaurants with customers, allowing them to sell otherwise unsold food at a discounted price at specified times. It essentially facilitates a clearance sale but for food! It reduces food wastage at restaurants, lets consumers grab inexpensive meals and regulates customer flow at the restaurant to optimize their resources and maximize profit on otherwise thrown-out food.

The online dashboard lets restaurants create special “boxes” of items that they would like to sell at a cheaper price. Restaurants have access to a graph of current traffic at the venue and are provided suggested times to schedule a discount based on past data and predicted traffic. The customer volume data would be collected by overhead cameras at the restaurant entrance, tracking the number of people walking in and out using OpenCV.

The app lets users search for active discount boxes in their area, reserve a box, and then head over to the restaurant and collect their meal! In order to reach a wider audience, we also allow users to search directly from Amazon Alexa by simply asking “Alexa, ask Munch to show me discounts near 08536”.
